## Installation

To install the dependencies for this project, use the following commands:

```sh
go mod tidy
```

## Configuration
The configuration file config/samples/config.yaml includes the following settings:  
* **server**: Server settings including the listen address.
* **akamai**: Akamai credentials including host, client secret, client token, and access token.
* **logs**: Logging settings including access log fields.
Example configuration:
```yaml
server:
  listenAddress: "127.0.0.1:8080"
  #config:
  #  read_buffer_size: 16384
akamai:
  host: "https://akamai.example.com"
  clientsecret: "your-client-secret"
  clientToken: "your-client-token"
  accessToken: "your-access-token"
logs:
  show_access_logs: true
  # If you want to log an user from a JWT Token, you can enable the jwt_user option and set the header name
  #jwt_user:
  #  enabled: true
  #  header: "Test"
  # JWT field which you want to log
  #  jwt_field: "email"
  access_logs_fields:
    - REQUEST:method
    - REQUEST:host
    - REQUEST:path
    - REQUEST:proto
    - REQUEST:referer
    - REQUEST:body

    - REQUEST_HEADER:user-agent
    - REQUEST_HEADER:x-forwarded-for
    - REQUEST_HEADER:x-real-ip

    - RESPONSE:status

    - RESPONSE_HEADER:content-length
```

## Usage
To run the project, use the following command:
```sh
go run cmd/main.go
```

For purging content, the application provides a POST endpoint at `/api/v1/purge`. The request body should include the following fields:
```json
{
    "purgeType": "urls", // "urls" or "cache-tags"
    "actionType": "invalidate", // "invalidate" or "delete"
    "environment": "production", // "production" or "staging"
    "postPurgeRequest": true, // Optional: Send GET requests after purge to warm the cache
    "paths": [ // List of paths to purge or cache tags to delete (depending on the purgeType)
      "/path1",
      "/path2"
    ]
}
```

### URL Duplication with imbypass Parameter

When using `purgeType: "urls"`, the application automatically duplicates each URL by adding the query parameter `imbypass=true`. This ensures that both the original URL and its bypass variant are purged from the Akamai cache.

**Example:**
If you request purging for `https://example.com/page`, the system will purge:
- `https://example.com/page`
- `https://example.com/page?imbypass=true`

This duplication applies to:
1. **Akamai Purge Request**: Both URL variants are sent to Akamai for cache invalidation/deletion
2. **Post-Purge GET Requests**: If `postPurgeRequest` is enabled, GET requests are sent to both variants to warm the cache

URLs with existing query parameters are handled correctly:
- `https://example.com/page?foo=bar` becomes both:
  - `https://example.com/page?foo=bar`
  - `https://example.com/page?foo=bar&imbypass=true`
## Logging
The project includes extensive logging capabilities. The logs can be configured in the config.yaml file under the logs section.  Example log fields:  
* REQUEST:method: HTTP method of the request.
* REQUEST:host: Host of the request.
* REQUEST:path: Path of the request.
* REQUEST:proto: Protocol of the request.
* REQUEST:referer: Referer of the request.
* REQUEST:body: Body of the request.
* REQUEST_HEADER:user-agent: User-Agent header of the request.
* REQUEST_HEADER:x-forwarded-for: X-Forwarded-For header of the request.
* REQUEST_HEADER:x-real-ip: X-Real-IP header of the request.
* RESPONSE:status: HTTP status of the response.
* RESPONSE_HEADER:content-length: Content-Length header of the response.

> Note:
You can log any header or field from the request or response by adding it to the access_logs_fields list in the config.yaml file. The logs will be printed to the console.
